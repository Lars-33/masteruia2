Xavier
In this project AI is not used, but can be useful for student in the future working on the same platforms. The JetPack and GPU is useless in this project. The Xavier uses ARM, and x86-64 is most used CPU architecture. Since more people are using x86-64 there are more help and software available online. 
It could be that the Xavier is amazing at AI applications and there is no product like it, i don't know. For the future i would recommend x86-64 CPU, no GPU and pure Ubuntu. A GPU dosen't hurt but not necessary unless the PC on the robot is going to run simulations or AI. Pure Ubuntu is preferable for a bigger community, faster updates and less bloat.
