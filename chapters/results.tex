The results of this thesis is documented in this Youtube playlist \cite{youtube_playlist_results}. The playlist consist of five videos. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item "TB w Nav2" is showing TB3 driving autonomous using ROS2 galacitc, Nav2, SLAM Toolbox. 
    \item "Nav2SLAM 2etg" is showing Husky driving autonomous using ROS2 foxy and galacitc, Nav2, SLAM Toolbox. 
    \item "TimeDelayTest" is video where the Husky is driven by teleop and the TB3 follows using the Time Delay algorithm. 
    \item Mimic is a video showing the the TB3 mimic the Husky controlled by teleop. 
    \item "HuskyNav2 TBsubpub" is showing Husky driving autonomous using ROS2 foxy and galacitc, Nav2, SLAM Toolbox while the TB3 is following using the Time Delay algorithm. 
\end{enumerate}
The two robots is also able to drive on a pre made map with Nav2 localization.
